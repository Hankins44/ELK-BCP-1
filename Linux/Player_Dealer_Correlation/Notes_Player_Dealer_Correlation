Summary of Fingings:

Times of Losses:
According to our Notes_Player_Analysis We've found that all roulette losses occured at either 5AM, 8AM, 2PM, 8PM, or 11PM

Player Suspect:
In our Player analysis we found only a single individual present at all losing roulette hours, Mylie Schmidt, no other
individual was present during more than one losing hour, thus making her the prime suspect.

Dealer Suspect:
In our Dealer analysis, Billy Jones, who worked a total of 15 hours across all days, was also the only one to work durng all the
games that Mylie Schmidt played. This leads us to believe he is her co-conspirator
